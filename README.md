Competition Entry for The Arbitrary Game Jam #2 (TAG)

Built in about 8 hours! (+ some polish time afterwards)

You are the King! Unfortunately, your kingdom is restless. The nobles are fickle and greedy and, as always, the peasants are just pesky and asking for things like food and basic human rights. Use your divine right (apparently just gold and meat dropping from the sky) to build your wealth and keep your kingdom happy.
